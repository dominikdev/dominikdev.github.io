12 Grid Responsive Framework
==============
This is a lightweight responsive framework that i put together. I based it on the 12-grid system that Bootstrap uses. It was build with the intention of being extremly lightweight for use in projects that don't require the extensive features that Bootstrap provides. It classifies screen sizes using bootstraps xs - lg technique. As well their system of offsetting content boxes. It was designed to be a lightweight framework to create responsive web pages.

The classes range from extra small (> 768px) to large (< 1200px)

**This is how a 6 column content box displays across various resolutions**
